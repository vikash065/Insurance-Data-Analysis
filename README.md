# 📊 Insurance Data Analysis – Power BI Project

A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze key insurance metrics including claims, customer demographics, policy trends, and financial performance — all powered by live data from Microsoft SQL Server.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

1. **Power BI Desktop** – For data visualization and reporting
2. **Microsoft SQL Server** – Source database connection
3. **Power Query** – Data extraction and transformation
4. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and KPIs
5. **Power BI Template (.pbit)** – Enables easy reuse with custom data inputs

## 🔍 Key Features

1. Interactive dashboard with drill-through capabilities and slicers
2. KPI cards highlighting total claims, customers, policy counts, and revenues
3. Segmentation by:
  a. Policy type and region
  b. Age group and gender
  c. Claim frequency and claim amount
4. Time-based trend analysis for claims and policy growth
5. Tooltip-enabled charts for deeper data context

## 🔌 Data Source

The report connects directly to a **Microsoft SQL Server** database, allowing for real-time data analysis. The `.pbit` template prompts users to enter their **SQL Server and database names**, ensuring seamless integration with their own data.

## ❗ Business Problem

Insurance providers often face challenges understanding which customer segments generate the most claims, which policies are most profitable, and where to focus retention or fraud-prevention efforts. Disconnected systems and static reports make it hard to act quickly on changing trends.

## ✅ Solution

This Power BI dashboard centralizes key insurance data, enabling dynamic exploration across all major performance areas. Stakeholders can instantly drill down by region, policy type, or customer demographic, identify outliers, monitor trends, and make faster, data-backed decisions.

## 📌 Example Use Case

> **Scenario:** A company notices rising claim costs in a specific region.
> **Using the dashboard:** They filter by region → view claim frequency by policy type → discover that motor insurance claims for young drivers          spiked 25% last quarter.
> **Action:** Marketing and risk teams adjust underwriting guidelines and targeted outreach accordingly.
